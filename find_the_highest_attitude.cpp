// 1732. Find the Highest Altitude

// There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes.
// The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.
// You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude
// between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.
